/*The base/ directory contains the files that define the foundation of your site, 
such as the typography and norms you want applied site-wide, like box-sizing*/


/*components/ is where you store BEM blocks that are more self-contained, such as buttons.
components are like "mini" layouts. Styles for small, reusable pieces of the site should reside here 
(think buttons, forms, profile pictures, etc.)*/


/*layouts/ is where you store BEM blocks which contain things that can be reused, such as a form or header for large layouts.
layout contains styles for different aspects of the site's structural layout (think of areas like nav bars, headers, footers, etc.) */


/*pages/  contains blocks of code that only apply to a single page. While you use buttons all over the site,
  your home page has a quote section and a project grid that isnâ€™t used anywhere else.
  In other words, pages/ are rules specific to a single page and won't be reused elsewhere.*/


/* utils/ is where you store variables, functions, mixins, and %placeholders for extensions (if you use them).
sometimes this is called abstracts*/
